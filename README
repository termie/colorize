colorize
========

A clean, visually distinguishing feature for your iterm2.

Colorize provides a script to randomly change the background color (and tab
color) of every new terminal when it starts, giving you a quick mnemonic for
remembering which windows are which.

The script just prints out some escape codes using iterm2's proprietary codes:

The colors are subtle and off-black, the defaults tend away from reds (because
I don't like them as much).
